  :description:
    Musical synthesizer, with adjustable and modular low-frequency oscillator,
    built from scratch with fundamental/simple circuit components (resistors,
    capacitors, tansistors, and operational amps).  Could proudly carry a
    decent tune.

  :description:
    Applying physical models to generate visualizations of complex
    multi-dimensional relational graphs as projections onto a two-dimensional
    mapping, based on self-organizing emergent principles, and recovering
    distinct clusters from the data.
